### FnordMetric Enterprise

FnordMetric Enterprise is a JVM-based timeseries database. It's a key-value store
(much like redis or memcached) where each key holds a "measurement". There are
different measurement methods like sum, mean, min/max, 90th percentile, etc. You
continuously add data to these keys/measurements which is aggregated and periodically
persisted.

FnordMetric Enterprise features disk persistence, a HTTP, TCP and UDP API, native
WebSockets support, CSV/JSON Export and a turnkey-ready HTML5 visualization solution
(FnordMetric UI). FnordMetric Enterprise can be used as a drop-in replacement for
StatsD+Graphite (it is a lot faster, see Benchmarks).

### FnordMetric UI

FnordMetric UI is a HTML5 API that lets you plug realtime data and charts into any webpage
without writing a single line of code. It gives you maximum flexiblitiy as you have full
control over layout and style with HTML and CSS.

FnordMetric UI uses WebSockets to communicate with a backend server. There are two backend
implementations: FnordMetric Classic (ruby + redis) and FnordMetric Enterprise (JVM). You can use
FnordMetric UI as a white label solution to power your custom realtime analytics apps.

### FnordMetric Classic

FnordMetric Classic is powered by ruby and redis. It offers a ruby DSL for processing data
streams and building beautiful web dashboards from a collection of turnkey-ready UI widgets.
You define your own plotting and aggregation methods as ruby blocks.  [See it in action! (RailsCasts)](http://railscasts.com/episodes/378-fnordmetric)
