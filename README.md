PlotFX is a tool for creating data-driven graphics; it allows you to create
parametric illustrations such as charts and dashboards using a lighweight
CSS-like syntax.

You can run PlotFX from the command line, where it generates SVG, PNG and PDF
output files. Additionally, you can embed it into your own application using the
C API.

PlotFX is built in the hope that using it will be quick, simple and fun.

**WARNING**: The master branch recently underwent a significant refactoring and the
stability is currently beta/experimental. Maybe not even that. It will take a few
more weeks to stabilize and document everything.

Getting Started
---------------

Here is how to draw a simple timeseries chart using plotfx:

    $ plotfx --in example_chart.ptx --out example_chart.svg

Output File (`example_chart.svg`):

[![A simple line chart](/examples/linecharts/simple_timeseries.svg)](./examples/linecharts/simple_timeseries.ptx)

Input File (`example_chart.ptx`):

    width: 1200px;
    height: 280px;

    scale-y-min: 0;
    scale-y-max: 140;

    lines {
      xs: csv('measurement.csv', time);
      ys: csv('measurement.csv', value2);
      colors: #06c;
    }

    axis {
      position: bottom;
      format: datetime("%H:%M:%S");
    }

    axis {
      position: left;
      layout: linear(20);
    }

Parts of the new chart specification syntax and semantics were inspired by ideas
from the "Grammar of Graphics" [0] and the ggplot2 project.
