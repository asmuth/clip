  The `plot/vectors` command takes an input data table, transforms it according
  to a user-provided scale configuration and then plots the data as vectors/arrows.

arguments:

  - name: data-x
    type: dataset
    desc: |
      Set the 'x' dataset for the plot. The 'x' dataset will be used to
      calculate the horizontal position of arrows.

  - name: data-y
    type: dataset
    desc: |
      Set the 'y' dataset for the plot. The 'y' dataset will be used to
      calculate the vertical position of arrows.

  - name: data-x
    type: dataset
    desc: |
      Set the 'dx' dataset for the plot. The 'x' dataset will be used to
      calculate the horizontal size of arrows.

  - name: data-y
    type: dataset
    desc: |
      Set the 'dy' dataset for the plot. The 'y' dataset will be used to
      calculate the vertical size of arrows.

  - name: size
    type: size
    desc: |
      Set the vector size.

  - name: sizes
    type: dataset_size
    desc: |
      Set an individual size for each vector

  - name: size-map
    type: measure_map
    desc: |
      Controls how input data in `sizes` is mapped to typographic units.

  - name: color
    type: color
    desc: |
      Set the vector color. Note that this value is only used if no colors
      option is specified.

  - name: colors
    type: dataset_colors
    desc: |
      Set an individual color for each vector. If no explicit `color-map`
      option is provided, the values in `colors` will be interpreted as
      hex color codes. Otherwise the mapping of input data to colors is controlled
      by the `color-map` option.

  - name: color-map
    type: color_map
    desc: |
      Controls how input data is mapped to colors. If no map is specified, the
      values in `colors` will be interpreted as hex color values.
