### I'm getting build errors when compiling the code

FnordMetric needs a reasonably modern C++ compiler and standard library. In most
cases where the code doesn't build it's due to some problem with the local build
environment. We always appreciate bug reports so we improve our build system, but
often the best workaround for the moment is to download a binary release from the
downloads page.
