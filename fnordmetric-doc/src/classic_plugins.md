There are currently two plugins for FnordMetric Classic, they are included in
the gem and enabled by default.

The gauge explorer is a small toop to browse all existing gauges and preview their data.

The gauge explorer plugin is enabled by default, you can disable it by setting `enable\_gauge\_explorer` to `false` (more about Configuration in [Running FnordMetric](/documentation/classic_running_fm)):

The active users plugin shows all incoming events and a list of currently online users (read
