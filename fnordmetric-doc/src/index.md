FnordMetric v1.1.2 Documentation
--------------------------------

FnordMetric is a framework for processing and visualizing stream data on
real-time analytics dashboards. It is split up into three components:

### FnordMetric Classic

FnordMetric Classic is powered by ruby and redis. It offers a ruby DSL for processing data
streams and building beautiful web dashboards from a collection of pre-made UI widgets.

You can also use the FnordMetric UI HTML5 API to display the data collected with FnordMetric
Classic on another website or build highly customized / white label views.

### FnordMetric UI

FnordMetric UI is a HTML5 / JavaScript API that lets you plug real-time data and charts into any
webpage without writing a single line of code. It gives you maximum flexiblitiy as you have full
control over layout and style with HTML and CSS.

FnordMetric UI uses WebSockets to communicate with a backend server. There are two backend
implementations: FnordMetric Classic (ruby + redis) and FnordMetric Enterprise (JVM).

You can use FnordMetric UI as a white label solution to power your custom real-time analytics apps.

### FnordMetric Enterprise

FnordMetric Enterprise is a JVM based timeseries database which serves as a backend for FnordMetric
UI. It can handle thousands of gauges and years worth of historical data. It does not depend on a
backend store like redis; it can be run in standalone mode or persist to an external database.

FnordMetric Enterprise includes some advanced features like Hadoop Integration and CSV Export.
