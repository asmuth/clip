better inetaddr:resolve iface:
  -> future<inteaddr> resolve(string);
  -> future<inetaddr> resolve(url); // resolves service port e.g. http->80, https->443
-> datetime -> walltime (or unixtime?), audit usage vs monotonic/tai time

-> queueworker abstraction (max concurrent jobs)

-> RPC::convertToFuture impl

-> spinlock

-> stringview class

-> benchmark + microoptimize StringUtil::split
-> benchmark + microoptimize URI#decode for long urls
-> use msgpack for rpcs because JSON#readString is slow
-> InetAddr#resolve blocks...

-> logstreamservice delete
-> logstreamservice getcuroffset

-> spinlock in http{client,server} connection
-> http server conn keepalie fixx

-> use redis async conn on eventloop instead of blocking conn

-> httpconnpoool: leaks connections, add idle timeout
-> cancelable wait

-> http connection timeouts + retry options

-> thread pool: max queue size + max thread size
-> thread pool wait()

-> timeout impl
-> eventloop shutdown

-> ratio of item visits to queries (only item visits but no queries -> fraud)
-> number of userids per source ip
-> session too long

-> sstable row format improvements
-> proper logger iface
-> exception refactoring
-> fix StringUtil::toString (should take const& param)
